This is some templated {{my_field.some_data}} text, using the data in example.yaml.

Here's processing of a list:
{{#each a_list}}
  - {{this.robot}} is at {{this.address}}
{{/each}}

Let's start with a robot's name:

{{ a_list.[0].robot }}

From that we can use a helper to get the name in lowercase:

{{ lowercase a_list.[0].robot }}

And here's another helper converting a list of fields into comma separated values:

{{ csv demo_robot.features }}

Here's inserting a custom component, backed by our data:
{{component demo_robot "DemoRobotTable" }}
